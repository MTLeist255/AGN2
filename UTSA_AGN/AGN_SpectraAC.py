# Plotting the CORRECTED wavelength and flux for spectral cassis,
# herschel and hawc data for several various AGN in our sample set.
# To run this program with available data, just un-comment which
# section you wish to use. Finally, once you are comfortable with the
# plot, uncomment the 'save.fig' function at the end of the code. Once
# the fig is saved, moved the completed plot to the correct folder for
# filing and reviewing.
